If the timing of the strike cannot be determined by a consensus of credible reporting by 5:00 PM ET on the day following the initial announcement/reporting, the strike will be considered to have occurred on the reported date at 12:00 PM in the time zone in which the strike occurred. \n\nIn the case of multiple strikes being announced/reported to have occurred on the same date, with a lack of a precise time being reported for one or multiple of the strikes, a consensus of credible reporting establishing which strike occurred first may be used to resolve the market even if the precise times of the strike(s) aren\u2019t known.\n\nIf no consensus of the order of the strikes exists, the market will resolve based on assuming a strike time of 12 PM local time (on the listed strike date) for any strike without a published time. \n\nIf a tie still persists due to a shared time zone, the market will resolve according to the order they were announced in.\n\nIf publication timestamps are identical or cannot be reliably compared, the market will resolve according to the alphabetical order of the struck countries listed names.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official public statements or publications by the U.S. government (including but not limited to AFRICOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM, INDOPACOM, SOCOM, the Department of Defense, the White House, or other U.S. agencies).

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purposes of this market, a qualifying \"strike\" is defined as the use of aerial bombs, drones or missiles (including cruise or ballistic missiles) launched by Israeli military forces that impact Iranian ground territory or any official Iranian embassy or consulate (e.g., if a weapons depot on Iranian soil is hit by an Israeli missile, this market will resolve to \"Yes\").\n\nMissiles or drones which are intercepted and surface-to-air missile strikes will not be sufficient for a \"Yes\" resolution regardless of whether they land on Iranian territory or cause damage.\n\nActions such as artillery fire, small arms fire, FPV or ATGM strikes directly, ground incursions, naval shelling, cyberattacks, or other operations conducted by Israeli ground operatives will not qualify.\n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.\n\nIf no qualifying strike is confirmed by the resolution date this market will remain open until the end of the second day after the resolution time. If the date/time of a qualifying strike cannot be confirmed by a consensus of credible reporting by that time, it will resolve to \"No\" regardless of whether a strike was later confirmed to have taken place.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThe United States will be considered to have forcibly removed Khamenei from power if Khamenei is detained, captured, surrenders, or otherwise loses his position or is prevented from fulfilling his duties as Supreme Leader of Iran as a direct result of actions of force, including strikes, invasions, or other operations, carried out by United States government forces.\n\nActions of force means the use of physical force, including but not limited to kinetic military action (e.g., missiles, bombs, gunfire), ground operations or raids, special operations, invasions, or physical arrests or detentions carried out by United States government forces. Sanctions, diplomacy, or other non-physical actions will not qualify.\n\nUnited States government forces refers to any active U.S. military (including U.S. Coast Guard), law enforcement, or intelligence personnel. Contractors confirmed to be acting under the orders of the United States government will count.\n\nActions of force carried out by United States government forces must directly lead to Khamenei\u2019s removal from power. United States actions which merely contribute to or assist in Khamenei\u2019s removal by other forces or through peaceful means will not suffice.\n\nQualifying examples (would count): The United States\u2019 2003 invasion of Iraq, which removed Saddam Hussein from power, and 1989 invasion of Panama, which led to Manuel Noriega\u2019s surrender to U.S. forces, would count. The United States 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, which largely toppled the Taliban government and removed the Taliban leadership from power, would also have counted. The 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada, which removed the existing regime from power, would count.\n\nNon-qualifying examples (would not count): The 2011 removal of Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya, however, in which the United States Military took part in a NATO operation against the Libyan military, including qualifying actions of force, but Gaddafi was removed by Libyan anti-government forces rather than U.S. government forces, would not count. The 1994 U.S.-led intervention in Haiti, in which the military regime relinquished power through negotiated departure rather than being forcibly removed from power by United States government forces as defined above, would not count. The removal of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 from power in Serbia, which occurred through domestic political processes rather than Milo\u0161evi\u0107's removal by United States government forces, would not count.\n\nThe resolution sources for this market will be official information from the United States federal government and a consensus of credible reporting.

The US initiates a military action on Iranian soil, airspace, or maritime territory or against any Iranian embassies or consulates by June 30, 2028, 11:59 PM ET. \n\nFor the purposes of this market, a \"military action\" will be considered to be any use of force executed by the US military on Iranian soil, airspace, or maritime territory (e.g. if a weapons depot on Iranian soil is hit by an US missile) that is officially acknowledged by the US government or a consensus of credible reporting. This includes, but is not limited to, airstrikes, naval attacks, or ground invasions. Cyber attacks, sanctions, or diplomatic actions will not count towards the resolution of this market.\n\n\n2. The Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s current ruling regime is NOT overthrown, collapsed, or otherwise ceases to govern by JJune 30, 2028, 11:59 PM ET. \n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s current ruling regime will be considered overthrown if a broad consensus of reporting indicating that core structures of the Islamic Republic (e.g. the office of the Supreme Leader, the Guardian Council, IRGC control under clerical authority) have been dissolved, incapacitated, or replaced by a fundamentally different governing system or otherwise lost de facto power over a majority of the population of Iran. This could occur via revolution, civil war, military coup, or voluntary abdication, but only qualifies if the Islamic Republic no longer exercises sovereign power.\n\nRoutine political events such as elections, reforms, or leadership succession do not qualify. Internal coups or power shifts that preserve the Islamic Republic\u2019s core structures also do not qualify. Only a clear break in continuity\u2014such as a new provisional government, revolutionary council, or constitution replacing the Islamic Republic will qualify.\n\nPartial loss of territory or challenges from rebel or exile groups will not qualify unless the Islamic Republic no longer administers the majority of the Iranian population within Iran.\n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.\n\nNote: If the Iranian regime falls - as defined above - prior to a qualifying U.S. military action, this market will immediately resolve to \"No\".

        "description": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if both of the following conditions are met by June 30, 2028, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\n\n1. The US initiates a military action on Iranian soil, airspace, or maritime territory or against any Iranian embassies or consulates by June 30, 2028, 11:59 PM ET. \n\nFor the purposes of this market, a \"military action\" will be considered to be any use of force executed by the US military on Iranian soil, airspace, or maritime territory (e.g. if a weapons depot on Iranian soil is hit by an US missile) that is officially acknowledged by the US government or a consensus of credible reporting. This includes, but is not limited to, airstrikes, naval attacks, or ground invasions. Cyber attacks, sanctions, or diplomatic actions will not count towards the resolution of this market.\n\n\n2. The Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s current ruling regime is NOT overthrown, collapsed, or otherwise ceases to govern by JJune 30, 2028, 11:59 PM ET. \n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s current ruling regime will be considered overthrown if a broad consensus of reporting indicating that core structures of the Islamic Republic (e.g. the office of the Supreme Leader, the Guardian Council, IRGC control under clerical authority) have been dissolved, incapacitated, or replaced by a fundamentally different governing system or otherwise lost de facto power over a majority of the population of Iran. This could occur via revolution, civil war, military coup, or voluntary abdication, but only qualifies if the Islamic Republic no longer exercises sovereign power.\n\nRoutine political events such as elections, reforms, or leadership succession do not qualify. Internal coups or power shifts that preserve the Islamic Republic\u2019s core structures also do not qualify. Only a clear break in continuity\u2014such as a new provisional government, revolutionary council, or constitution replacing the Islamic Republic will qualify.\n\nPartial loss of territory or challenges from rebel or exile groups will not qualify unless the Islamic Republic no longer administers the majority of the Iranian population within Iran.\n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.\n\nNote: If the Iranian regime falls - as defined above - prior to a qualifying U.S. military action, this market will immediately resolve to \"No\".

Strikes on U.S. military unmanned aerial vehicles/projectiles and U.S. commercial/civilian ships will NOT count toward a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nOnly military actions by Iranian forces explicitly claimed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, or confirmed to have originated from Iranian territory will count toward the resolution of this market. Attacks on the U.S. military by proxy forces (i.e. Hezbollah, Houthis, etc.) will not count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is official statements from the U.S. and Iranian governments, however a consensus of credible may also be used.",

        "description": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if there is a military engagement between the military forces of the United States of America and Iran between market creation and the listed date, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nA \"military engagement\" is defined as any incident involving the use of force such as missile strikes, artillery fire, exchange of gunfire, or other forms of direct military engagement between US and Iranian military forces. Non-violent actions, such as warning shots, artillery fire into uninhabited areas, or missile launches that land in territorial waters or pass through airspace, will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. Intentional ship ramming that results in significant damage to (e.g., a hole in the hull) or the sinking of a military ship by another will count toward a \"Yes\" resolution; however, minor damage (scrapes, dents) will not. Any U.S. military kinetic strike that impacts Iranian land territory will qualify for a \u201cYes\u201d resolution. \n\nMissiles or drones which are intercepted and surface-to-air missile strikes will not be sufficient for a \"Yes\" resolution, regardless of whether they land on adversarial territory or cause damage.\n\nNote: the U.S. Coast Guard is a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces; the Iranian Law Enforcement Command is a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces; all sub-branches of the Artesh, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (including the Basij), and Law Enforcement Command are part of the Iranian Armed forces.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThis requires a broad consensus of reporting indicating that core structures of the Islamic Republic (e.g. the office of the Supreme Leader, the Guardian Council, IRGC control under clerical authority) have been dissolved, incapacitated, or replaced by a fundamentally different governing system or otherwise lost de facto power over a majority of the population of Iran. This could occur via revolution, civil war, military coup, or voluntary abdication, but only qualifies if the Islamic Republic no longer exercises sovereign power.\n\nRoutine political events such as elections, reforms, or leadership succession do not qualify. Internal coups or power shifts that preserve the Islamic Republic\u2019s core structures also do not qualify. Only a clear break in continuity\u2014such as a new provisional government, revolutionary council, or constitution replacing the Islamic Republic will qualify.\n\nPartial loss of territory or challenges from rebel or exile groups will not qualify unless the Islamic Republic no longer administers the majority of the Iranian population within Iran. \n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.

Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nTo qualify, the talks must involve official representatives of both governments and focus primarily on nuclear issues, such as uranium enrichment, sanctions relief, IAEA inspections, or the JCPOA. Talks may be direct or mediated, and may occur in person or virtually.\n\nOnly the actual resumption of talks will count; announcements that talks have been scheduled to resume will not alone qualify.\n\nUnofficial backchannel communications, general diplomatic meetings not centered on nuclear issues, or one-sided public proposals will not qualify.\n\nThe market will resolve based on a consensus of credible reporting.",

        "description": "On June 13, 2025 Iranian leaders announced they no longer plan to engage in nuclear talks with the U.S. that were scheduled to take place in Oman on Sunday (see: https://thehill.com/policy/international/5348689-iran-nuclear-deal-talks-suspended/).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if it is confirmed that official nuclear-related negotiations between the United States and Iran resume at any point on by March 31, 2028, at 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nTo qualify, the talks must involve official representatives of both governments and focus primarily on nuclear issues, such as uranium enrichment, sanctions relief, IAEA inspections, or the JCPOA. Talks may be direct or mediated, and may occur in person or virtually.\n\nOnly the actual resumption of talks will count; announcements that talks have been scheduled to resume will not alone qualify.\n\nUnofficial backchannel communications, general diplomatic meetings not centered on nuclear issues, or one-sided public proposals will not qualify.\n\nThe market will resolve based on a consensus of credible reporting.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nIf such an agreement is officially reached before the resolution date, this market will resolve to \"Yes\", regardless of if/when the agreement goes into effect.\n\nAgreements that include the United States and Iran as parties, even if they also involve other countries (e.g., a multilateral deal like the JCPOA), will qualify for resolution.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be an official announcement by the United States and/or the Islamic Republic of Iran, however an overwhelming consensus of credible reporting confirming an agreement has been reached will also qualify.",

This could occur via revolution, civil war, military coup, or voluntary abdication, but only qualifies if the Islamic Republic no longer exercises sovereign power.\n\nRoutine political events such as elections, reforms, or leadership succession do not qualify. Internal coups or power shifts that preserve the Islamic Republic\u2019s core structures also do not qualify. Only a clear break in continuity\u2014such as a new provisional government, revolutionary council, or constitution replacing the Islamic Republic will qualify.\n\nPartial loss of territory or challenges from rebel or exile groups will not qualify unless the Islamic Republic no longer administers the majority of the Iranian population within Iran. \n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThis requires a broad consensus of reporting indicating that core structures of the Islamic Republic (e.g. the office of the Supreme Leader, the Guardian Council, IRGC control under clerical authority) have been dissolved, incapacitated, or replaced by a fundamentally different governing system or otherwise lost de facto power over a majority of the population of Iran. This could occur via revolution, civil war, military coup, or voluntary abdication, but only qualifies if the Islamic Republic no longer exercises sovereign power.\n\nRoutine political events such as elections, reforms, or leadership succession do not qualify. Internal coups or power shifts that preserve the Islamic Republic\u2019s core structures also do not qualify. Only a clear break in continuity\u2014such as a new provisional government, revolutionary council, or constitution replacing the Islamic Republic will qualify.\n\nPartial loss of territory or challenges from rebel or exile groups will not qualify unless the Islamic Republic no longer administers the majority of the Iranian population within Iran. \n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purposes of this market, a qualifying \"strike\" is defined as the use of aerial bombs, drones or missiles (including cruise or ballistic missiles) launched by Israeli or Iranian military forces that impact the other party\u2019s ground territory or any official embassy or consulate (e.g., if a weapons depot on Iranian soil is hit by an Israeli missile, or an Israeli air base is hit by an Iranian drone, this market will resolve to \"Yes\") that is officially acknowledged by the relevant government or a consensus of credible reporting.\n\nMissiles or drones which are intercepted and surface-to-air missile strikes will not be sufficient for a \"Yes\" resolution regardless of whether they land on the opposing party\u2019s territory or cause damage.",
